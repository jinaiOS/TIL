# Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completenes
## Your app or its metadata does not appear to include complete and final content.

App Store users expect the apps they download to be ready for public use. Apps on the store shouldn't include placeholder or incomplete content or information.

**Next Steps**

To resolve this issue, please revise your app and metadata so that all of its content is complete and final.

For example:

- Your app binary or metadata should not include "lorem ipsum" text.
- App metadata should not include placeholder screenshots, such as "screenshot coming soon."
